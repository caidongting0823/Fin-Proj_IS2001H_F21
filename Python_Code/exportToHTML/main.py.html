      <span class="s4">&quot;to the Antikythera mechanism, to the difference engine, and finally to the first generation of computers known &quot;</span>
      <span class="s4">&quot;to the world as the revolutionary but giant, the ENIAC, born in Philadelphia in 1946. You will see that our &quot;</span>
      <span class="s4">&quot;“physiological system” is constantly evolving. You will find that our “physiological system” is evolving, &quot;</span>
      <span class="s4">&quot;and our functions are gradually changing from a single numerical calculation to a more diversified way of &quot;</span>

*** Message from Dongting *** 
 
Dear professors and students of IS 2001H (Fall 2021), 
 
Hey! Here is Dongting. Hope you enjoy the conversion with AI.  
 
It is a great honor to have the opportunity to spend this entire semester with you. Throughout this semester,  
I benefited a lot and thought about many things I had never thought about before. And your tolerance, encouragement,  
and wonderful performance are also the driving force that makes me courageous to express myself.  
 
This project was an idea I had when I was in Week 5 Reflection, due to the task requirement being non-visual content,  
I moved it into the Final Project. I'm glad it worked-I debugged the python file many times before it looked like it  
is today. Just now, the content discussed by AI is very interesting.  
 
As mentioned, there are many similarities between the evolution of humans and computers, and the emergence of  
artificial intelligence has brought the concept between humans and machines closer. How should we view the ethical  
issues that may arise? How to deal with new developments? Everyone has a different answer.  
 
I hope you can have a pleasant conversation with AI (actually, AI is..., you know)!  
The above is all the dialogue content of this project.  
 
FYI, part of the dialogue content will vary based on your choices.  
If you want to explore all branches, you can start again after finishing the conversion later.  
 
Thank you again for reading all the contents of the project patiently!  
Hope you have a good day :)  
 
Dongting,  
Dec 13, 2021
